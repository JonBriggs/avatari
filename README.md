avatari
=======

An educational incentive system built around acquiring runes and using them to upgrade an avatar.

The intent is to build an LTI app (for integration with canvas (https://github.com/instructure/canvas-lms).

Upon launch, students will create an account with the app. Teachers will have the ability to load in runes or some other currency name
As students acquire runes they can open chests of varying values. Chests that cost more to open have better gear in them.

As the students acquire points in their school work - they also have the ability to get gear. As they get gear they can dress up their 
avatar. The avatar can then be posted back into canvas as their user account image.

This is an iGrant sponsored idea from Eastside Preparatory School which seeks to understand more about how gaming style incentive structures
can positively impact education.  Contributors welcome.
